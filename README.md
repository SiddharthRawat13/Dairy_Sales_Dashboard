**Amul Dairy Sales Dashboard Report**

**Overview**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Amul's dairy sales performance, showcasing key metrics and trends across various dimensions.

**Total Sales**

* Amul achieved a total sales value of ₹648.96K.
* Retail channels dominate sales, contributing ₹2.28M, followed by online sales at ₹1.14M. Wholesale sales are negligible.

**Sales Trends**

* The quantity of Amul products sold has remained relatively stable from 2020 to 2022, with a slight dip in 2021.
* Inventory levels (quantity in stock) have generally exceeded sales, indicating sufficient stock availability. However, there's a notable decline in both stock and sales in 2022, suggesting potential challenges in demand or production.

**Regional Performance**

* Chandigarh is the top-performing region for Amul, generating ₹402.55K in sales.
* Delhi and Uttar Pradesh follow, contributing ₹275.57K and ₹154.33K respectively.
* Haryana and Maharashtra have significantly lower sales figures.
* There doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between the number of cows in a region and sales performance.

**Product Performance**

* Milk is the highest-selling product category for Amul, followed by cheese and paneer.
* Inventory levels for most products generally match sales, except for butter, which has a higher stock level compared to sales.

**Storage Conditions**

* The majority of Amul's land area is dedicated to refrigerated storage, followed by frozen storage. Tetra pack and polythene packaging have minimal land allocation.

**Key Insights and Recommendations**

* **Focus on Retail:** Given the dominance of retail sales, Amul should prioritize strategies to maintain and expand its presence in this channel.
* **Investigate 2022 Dip:** The decline in sales and inventory levels in 2022 warrants further investigation to identify the root causes and potential solutions.
* **Optimize Butter Inventory:** The excess inventory of butter suggests a need to adjust production or explore promotional activities to stimulate demand.
* **Regional Strategies:** Tailor marketing and distribution strategies to each region's specific characteristics, considering the variations in sales performance and cow population.

This dashboard offers valuable insights into Amul's dairy sales performance, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and optimize their sales strategies.
